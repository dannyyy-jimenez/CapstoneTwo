### Image Classification and NLP on MCU Script
Using the Avengers dataset of images and the MCU database with the scripts from the films. I'll run image classification on the images to predict who is who. And Using the script database ill do NLP to predict who said the line.

### Image Classification on Different Artists
  I'll webscrape a bunch of google images by search query for different artists and download images for different artists. Then I'll make a classifier to be able to predict which artist is in the picture.

### Prediction on Pneumonia Based on Images

Using Kaggle Image Dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia] I'll make a neural network that can predict whether the given X-Ray is an X-Ray with a disease.

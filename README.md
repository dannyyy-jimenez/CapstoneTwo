### Image Classification on Different Artists
  I'll webscrape a bunch of google images by search query for different artists and download images for different artists. Then I'll make a classifier to be able to predict which artist is in the picture.


### NLP on Messenger Messages

  Using Selenium I'll query a bunch of messages from my messenger on different people and given a "test message" ill have my model predict who sent the message based on the lingo they use.


### Prediction on Pneumonia Based on Images

Using Kaggle Image Dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia] I'll make a neural network that can predict whether the given X-Ray is an X-Ray with a disease.
